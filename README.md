# 🎮 Maze Runner – Memory Maze Game

**Maze Runner** is a browser-based memory maze game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The challenge is simple but intense: **you can only see what’s close to you**. Walls disappear the moment you move away, forcing you to rely on memory to reach the exit.

---

## 🧠 Gameplay Concept

* You start in the **top-left corner**
* The **exit is hidden** in one of the other three corners
* Only nearby cells are visible
* Walls disappear instantly when out of view
* The maze **grows larger** as levels increase
* Reach the exit to advance to the next level

This creates a true **memory-based maze experience**.
